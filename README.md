### Project Topic: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

### Introduction

This project is part of the prerequisite to completing the Google Data Analytics program on COURSERA. This project involves using R programming language, SQL, and Spreadsheet to perform a Cyclistic bike-share analysis for a company based in Chicago, United States. The project aims to understand how Casual riders and Annual Member riders use Cyclistic bikes differently and how to convert casual riders into annual members.

### Business Objective

The following were the questions answered from the insight gained from analyzing the data. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual membership? How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?


### Description

The Cyclistic bike-share dataset is open-sourced data gotten from Motivate International Inc. under the license [Here](https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement). The dataset used was from July 2021 to June 2022 and contained twelve (12) zipped files for the last 12 months.
The combined CSV files consist of Thirteen (13) columns and over five million (5900856) rows/records. The link to the dataset can be found [Here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)
Two new calculated columns (ride_length & day_of_week) were added to each of the twelve files of the dataset using a spreadsheet.
This project was completed by harnessing the skills learned from Google Data Analytics and relying heavily on Stackoverflow and Google to debug error codes whenever they showed up.

### Limitation
Additional data such as information about the rider's age, gender, address, and income would have helped to expound more on the recommendations and insights generated.
